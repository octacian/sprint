# Settings found in Advanced Settings -> Mods -> Sprint

#    Primary key that triggers a sprint speed multiplier when held.
#    This defaults to aux1, which is also used if fast_move is enabled.
sprint_primary (Primary Sprint Key) string aux1

#    Secondary key that triggers the speed and jump multipliers when double-pressed
#    and held for the duration. This is most convenient to map to the "up" ("forward")
#    key, as it allows seemlessly enabling sprint by simply double-tapping forward
#    without having to move your hand to reach another key.
sprint_second (Secondary Sprint Key) string up

#    If disabled, the secondary sprint key (sprint_second) is not allowed.
sprint_enable_second (Allow Secondary Sprint Key) bool true

#    Speed multiplier applied when sprinting.
#    Sprint key configured with the sprint_primary setting.
sprint_speed (Speed Multiplier) float 1.8

#    Jump multiplier applied when sprinting.
#    Sprint key configured with the sprint_primary setting.
sprint_jump (Jump Multiplier) float 1.1

#    If enabled, sprinting is only allowed when moving forward, and disallowed
#    when moving in any other direction.
sprint_dir (Directional Sprinting) bool true

#    Configures the number of particles to be added behind the player as they
#    sprint. A greater number gives more variety but causes more load on the server.
#    If set to 0, no particles are spawned.
sprint_particles (Max Number of Particles to Spawn) int 1 0 10
